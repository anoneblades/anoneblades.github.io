		2. WHAT SPECIFIC TERMS APPLY TO YOU DEPENDING ON YOUR COUNTRY OF RESIDENCE?
		 <br>
		<br>
		The protection of your personal information is an essential part of our activities. In order to provide you with a personalized experience, we will apply the data protection laws of your country of residence. This approach would also be consistent with consumer laws of the country of your habitual residence, and would hence allow us to better meet your expectations regarding the protection of your personal information.

		3. WHO COLLECTS & USES YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?
		 <br>
		<br>
		We, Balenciaga SAS, act as the “data controller”, which means that we determine “why” and “how” your personal information is collected and used. We are a French corporation located in 16-18, rue Vaneau 75007 Paris, France and registered under number 775 668 122 with the company registry of Paris.
		<br>
		To be able to deliver our products and services to you, we need to share your personal information with approved partners or other members of Kering who generally act as our "data processors". All are bound by an obligation to implement appropriate security measures to protect personal information in their possession and are bound by a strict confidentiality agreement and specific contractual terms on "how" and "when" they are allowed to use your personal information on our behalf.
		<br>
		Please be aware that certain approved partners, such as our franchisees and licensees or social media, could also determine "why" and "how" your personal information is used. They have their own privacy and cookies policies, so remember that the personal information you give them will be subject to their rules and not ours.
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>

		 <br>
		<br>
		Balenciaga will collect, record, hold, organize, structure, store, update, adapt, combine, consult, use, transfer and disclose your personal information for the purposes described in this section. Your personal information will not be further used for purposes incompatible or inconsistent with the purposes for which it was collected, unless permitted by the applicable legislation.
		<br>
		The processing of your personal information will comply with your privacy legislation and rely on the legal bases set out in this section. The legal bases listed in this section will also apply when we share your data with third parties (as listed in the section With whom do we share your personal information?) for the purposes mentioned below.
		<br>

		 <br>
		<br>
		 <br>
		<br>
		To provide you with the products and services you have purchased or otherwise requested
		<br>
		We will use your personal information to manage our relationship with you and to perform our obligations under the contract you conclude with us when you purchase or otherwise request products or services from us. This can cover various activities such as internal accounting, processing your payment or delivery.
		<br>










		 

		 
		<br>
		To manage your Balenciaga profile.
		<br>
		Once you have requested us to create your Balenciaga profile, via Balenciaga websites or any other means, including our customer service, your personal information will be linked to this profile, where we will keep all the information we have on you. This could include personal information we obtain directly from you as well as from other sources in accordance with applicable legislation. This could also include information about the purchases made when checking out as a guest or when checking out using a profile. The information in your Balenciaga profile is crucial to provide you with the Balenciaga personalized and tailored experience, and in some cases is necessary in order to access to some specific services or to purchase from our website, and thus it needs to be kept up to date for the best experience.
		<br>










		 

		 

		To provide you with tailored customer service and assistance.
		<br>
		You should have the same unified experience no matter how we communicate. Whether this happens in our stores, on our website, by chat, by phone or by video, and whether you contact us or we contact you, we want to provide you with relevant and tailored customer service.
		<br>
		For this purpose of providing you the Balenciaga experience, we will collect, store, process, use, disclose and transfer your personal information and other information you submit to us to be able to identify you, to provide service to you, or to improve our products or services. This will allow us to provide you with the tailored assistance you are asking for or to share relevant information with you. In addition, when you contact us, we may retain the personal information or other information you share with us to always provide you with such a customised and personalised experience. This could happen if you are an existing or potential customer. Your personal information will be linked to your Balenciaga profile, if you have requested us to create one, or to a temporary record. Any messages you send us in any chat may be recorded or monitored for customer service or other reasons.
		<br>
		To provide you with a smooth and enjoyable customer experience, know you better to provide you with tailored answers, and to improve the quality and security of our services, we may rely on your consent, proceed in accordance with our contract with you, or take all reasonable steps to enter into a contract with you, or rely on our legitimate interest to improve our services.

Such communication can be global or local, and may include updates about our products and services, notifications, invitations to events, offers, surveys, etc.]
		<br>
		Our communications will be customised and specifically designed to be of interest to you and will be updated with any new personal information linked to your Balenciaga profile. We will thus use your personal information to send you tailored communications or other customised advertisements or marketing campaigns. This use of your information includes some profiling activity.

		To conduct our business securely and protect our activities and personnel.

		To deliver our products and services safely to you, perform our contract properly or comply with some of our legal obligations, we will implement fraud prevention and detection measures. Such measures will allow us to adequately perform our contract with you and/or protect our legitimate interests in defending ourselves against fraud. We may notably implement measures to ensure that you are complying with our terms and conditions for sales, available in this website, offers and programs, and to prevent and detect non-compliance or fraud by you. This may include reviewing and assessing your dealings with us, your eligibility to participate in certain sales, offers and programs, your compliance with the terms and conditions of such sales, offers and programs, and undertaking enforcement action and/or disciplinary action where such non-compliance or fraud is suspected or identified.
